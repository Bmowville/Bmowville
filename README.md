# Hi, I'm Bryan 👋

I build data products end-to-end, from ingestion and modeling to dashboards and reproducible analysis.

## What I do
- Data pipelines and analytics engineering (Python, SQL)
- Machine learning workflows and evaluation
- Dashboards and reporting that are easy to run and understand

## Tech
Python • SQL • Pandas • Dash • Docker • Git

## Currently building
I’m shipping a small set of repositories focused on pipeline projects, ML experiments, and dashboards, all with clear documentation and reproducible steps.

## Projects
- **Data Engineering Lab** — practical pipelines in Python + SQL (SQLite), with reproducible outputs
  
  Repo: https://github.com/Bmowville/data-engineering-lab
  
- **Mini SQL Challenges** — Short SQL case studies (SQLite/Postgres style): cleaning, aggregation, window functions, and analytics
